## Flock mode :
    * acquisition : proximity
    * proximity causes course to alter to average vector V' = ( Va + Vb ) / 2
## merge mode :
    * acquisition : contact
    * collision merges 2 boids into 1
    * collided boids each transfer half their graphical properties to merger result
## zombie mode :
    * acquisition : proximity
    * zombie shift : contact
    * select boid insert type, zombie or normal
    * if normal random motion, flee acquired zombie if in range
    * if zombie random motion, chase acquired boid if in range
## mitosis mode
    * acquisition : contact
    * collision creates a new boid
    * collided boids each transfer half their graphical properties to mitosis result
    *
